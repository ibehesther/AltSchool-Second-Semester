## Set up a new nodejs project and do the following 
- Create a new server (index.js)

- Establish the following routes (no libraries allowed) inside index.js using the specified method:

    - Users:
        - CreateUser - POST
        - AuthenticateUser - POST
        - getAllUsers - GET

    - Books:
        - Create - POST
        - Delete - DELETE
        - LoanOut - POST
        - Return - POST
        - Update - PUT

- You'll get a better understanding of each of these routes later (you'll also get a chance to change the structures as you like).
